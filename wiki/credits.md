# Credits

I would like to thank **José Antonio Gimeno** for his continued support and advice, and **Miguel Frutos** for his suggestions on the Dispose Pattern.

Also, thanks to **dreamlax** for testing the library on several platforms.

The design of the "sheep logo" ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillermocalvo/exceptions4c/master/etc/img/logo/sheep_016.png) was based on an original idea of **Iris Zaldívar**.
