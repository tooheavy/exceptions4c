#summary Multithread support

= Multithreading =

If you are using threads in your program, you must enable the _thread-safe_ version of the library by defining `E4C_THREADSAFE` at compiler level.

The usage of the framework does not vary between single and multithreaded programs. The same semantics apply. The only caveat is that *the behavior of signal handling is undefined in a multithreaded program* so use this feature with caution.
