## Integration

Whether you are developing a standalone application, or an external library that
provides services to independent programs, you can integrate `exceptions4c` in
your code very easily.

The system provides a mechanism for implicit initialization and finalization of
the exception framework, so that it is safe to use `try`, `catch`, `throw`, etc.
from any external function, even if its caller is not exception-aware
whatsoever.
